= [blue]*Generate TLObjects*

==== [black]*TL schema file contains two parts.*
* [red]*constructor*
* [red]*method*

---


At First TL schema should be added to [red]#_tl-schema-86_# file.

NOTE: Depends on type of TL, add schema to constructor or method part.

Now we should generate schema to create new TL classes.
For this purpose open GenerateClasses.kt file.
It contains main method.
Run main and wait until finish classes generation.
Thats right.
Now new TL classes has generated.
But Unfortunately some of other Tl classes has changed by generator.
They should have no changes. So open local changes and revert those classes.
Then add new classes to git, commit and push.
_Now your work has finished._
